Quick fix deploying -----------------------------------------Q/A:--------------------------------[Question:] Can you elaborate a bit more in details the\nbackground/context of this proposal (benefit section), is it related to\nInterACT, D&M telemetry or wireline telemetry?[Answer]:This idea “Customer side\nsoftware debugging with Telemetry” is about to remotely debug any SLB software\nthat released and installed on customer owned computers. I am now working on InterACT\nteam, so I can give an example on it as:\n\nAfter SLB customer “ABC”\nbought the InterACT product and installed it on their servers,  when\nInterACT don’t behave as expected, then SLB engineers can do remote debug as:\n1. Run the Telemetry tool from inside SLB. 2. Switch on Remote Debug Telemetry with ABC engineer. This need the ABC engineer’s collaborating.3. Collect logs/ capture screen shots on ABC servers, conduct remote debugging from SLB side. This can be done via mobile service/WNS/remote TS 4. Do quick fixings, and release patch(or DLL simply) to ABC5. Running the SLB agent on ABC servers, then the agent will deploy the patch or replace the DLL automatically.------------------------------------------------------[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion]:will the customer side firewall block the debugging channel from/backward with SLB?[Answer:]No. Directly connect with customer side server is only one of the several ways for the remote debugging. we will mainly use the mobile service and cloud side notification service as the debugging channel.--------------------------------------------------------[Question:] how to instrument the product code before release to customer? is there a ready to use tool or, is there an industry well-known tool on it?[Answer:]we will create a tool to automatically instrument the code, then manually instrument the product code with sepcifically requests.there is no industry generally used tool to instrument the code, it is product specified tools. I have no dedicate information on which instrument tool is the industry-well-known one.btw, creating an instrument tool will be an interesting work.\n','    		',NULL,'Idea',0,'yhao',NULL,'2015-06-08 10:11:50','2015-06-24 15:17:04',0,NULL,'','http://','QA.jpg','/Uploads/Image/2015-06-23/5588fbaad3108.jpg'),(176,'quizexample.png','Schlumberger Software Errata','Mistakes are meant for learning, not repeating!','We found many issues in our software during the bug fixing and code review, then we fix them. \n<br/>But unfortunately we found similar issues happened again and again in our later bug fixing and cod review.','I suggest we build one software mistakes database.\n<br/>1.

(We will focus on this part in this innovation)\n2.MWD engineer measures from the TeleScope ROP to the DD scribe line clockwise while looking downhole, and then measures the circumference.\n3.MWD engineer then converts the measurement to an angle.\n4.Thie tool face correction is then entered into MaxWell and is used to offset the angle sent up by TeleScope.  Step 1 is a fairly time-consuming procedure. Some time there will a some flex collar and LWD tools between Motor and TeleScope, and their distance would be more than 30 meters. Take this scenario for example.\na.On rig floor, rig crew connect Bit<=Motor<=Flex Collar<=LWD1<=LWD2<=MWD(Telescope), elevator stop and will move up until Motor come to rig floor level\nb.Directional Driller stand in front of Scribe line of Motor, with a hand (vertical) pointing to it, then hold this position, no movement.\nc.Driller move BHA downhole slowly, after down 5 meters, stop. Directional Driller (DD) draw a line to collar in front of him (steady hand as reference). Still DD cannot move, including his steady hand.\nd.Repeat step 3, until MWD (TeleScope) tool come in front of DD, DD draw a line to the same level at the ROP of MWD (TeleScope), and stick a red rubber ear plug to the line.\ne. Driller move BHA up again, until Motor come in front of DD. Then DD look up to check line between the red rubber ear plug and Scribe line of Motor are a vertical line.\n\nFrom my point view, this Step 1 is time consuming, and DD have to stand there still for long time, what\'s worse, the position of drawing line is not accurate. When at night, the red rubber ear plug is not clear when it was more than 30 meters far away.','One solution for this, is to use laser light to release job of DD in this procedure.\nIn step b, use a laser light to release DD. This laser light can project a thin vertical line on BHA. It should overlap with Scribe line of Motor first.\nThen Driller slowly move BHA down, until MWD (TeleScope) come to rig floor level, and of course, laser light will project a line on Telescope collar, DD just draw a line overlap with laser light line. Then this job is down, and much more accurate then human.','1.Accurate Tool Face Correction\n2.Save time on setting BHA, time is money on rig.\n3.Easy Directional Driller ','/Uploads/./2015-06-15/557eabb8c56b2.pptx','Idea',0,'yshi2',NULL,'2015-06-15 18:40:56','2015-06-29 17:06:50',3,NULL,'','http://','Full.png','/Uploads/Image/2015-06-16/5580018008ed8.png'),(233,NULL,'SLB Official Accounts','SLB Official Accounts','Now SLBers get information about company from Hub or email.

A drilling engineer will then produce the trajectory, which can be used to calculate the MD of the different casing shoes, and thus the whole wellbore geometry.  However, even at this stage, the various hydraulics traffic lights cannot be computed, because only the Mud Weight is know, not the rheology of the fluid.  In this situation, the software should be able to go to the database of offset fluid reports, use the Mud Weight as an input, and generate the range of expected values of the rheology.

Clients typically give us compositions in mole fraction, in particular for gas condensate. To compare DFA measured compositions with laboratory data, we need to convert weight fractions to mole fractions. On the other hand, any EoS modeling requires mole fractions as input. \n\nCurrent DFA delumping method is very rough, molecular weight of C6+ is very inaccuracy which greatly affects accuracy of EoS modeling because of inaccurate mole fractions as EoS inputs. Unfortunately, the inaccurate method has already been implemented into SIS PVTBlue (One Fluid) for our DFA prediction workflow which is widely used in field for reservoir connectivity/compartmentalization analysis with the Flory-Huggins-Zuo equation of state coupled with DFA measurements. In the near future, this method will be used for MPVT & FPVT modules of FLCN for EoS model tuning when saturation pressure is available. Of course, this inaccurate method is not acceptable for our new generation of DFA tools. Therefore, we need much better way to improve the results. In addition, it is important for our new DFA tools to report not only weight fraction but also mole fraction.','To achieve this goal, here are what we need to do: - Collect laboratory measured composition data for different fluid samples as many as possible – a database - Lump the laboratory GC compositions into DFA like compositions in weight and mole fractions and also molecular weight of C6+. - Develop different methods to obtain molecular weight of C6+: \nCorrelations with DFA measurements as inputs - Machine training method: LS-SVM (least square-support vector machine) or/and ANN (artificial neuronal network) - Evaluate the obtained methods using the data which are not included in training  - Convert weight fractions to mole fractions using the molecular weight - Patent memo: “Method for predicting reservoir fluids phase behavior with quantified uncertainty during wireline-conveyed in-situ fluid analysis operations” - Final report- The specific execution plan and H1 review PPT can be found at the link: http://mysite.slb.com/personalsite/kwang72/Shared%20Documents/HPS_BGC_Innovation2015.zipx.- The patent memo has been submitted to IP and cannot be disclosed herein.','This algorithm will significantly impact current DFA prediction workflow which has been implemented in SIS PVTBlue (One Fluid) for EoS modeling.
